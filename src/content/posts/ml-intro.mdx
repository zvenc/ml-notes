# Introduction

Let's talk about machine learning. It's a rapidly advancing field and its relevance can't be understated. It's provided solutions to complex problems that traditional algorithms are unable to solve by essentially teaching computers to learn how to solve these problems. It sounds very outlandish to say "teaching computers" but, with the help of math, probability theory and a boatload of statistics, computers have gotten really good at observing patterns and copying them. My goal is gain and in-depth understanding of how this has been achieved and see how I can apply this knowledge to provide creative solutions to complex problems around me. Join me as i dive headfirst into the interesting but unbelievably _convoluted_ world of machine learning (pun intended).

I'm going to dive into two fundamental categories of machine learning:
- Supervised Learning
- Unsupervised Learning

While there are other types of machine learning, these two are the most relevant at this stage.

## Supervised Learning

This approach to machine learning involves giving the computer a number of examples to learn from in the form of input-output pairs. Basically an input, also called a _feature_ is mapped to an output, also called _target_, and the computer observes a list of these mappings and tries to predict what the output should be for an input that isn't a part of the original mappings.

For example, let's say you plot house prices against house sizes for about 15 houses. The goal would be to get the computer to estimate the price of a house based on its size, especially for houses not represented in the dataset.
