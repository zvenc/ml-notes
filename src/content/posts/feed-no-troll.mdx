excerpt: Literally, all you have to do is nothing...
---
Oftentimes, when I'm wandering around the corridors of the internet, I can't help but notice the abundance of incendiary content. To me, it's as clear as sparkling water that such content was created for the sole purpose of getting a rise out of people, yet their engagement numbers are in the millions. I won't act like I don't _take the bait_ every once in a while but I've met people whose social media feeds are filled with this kind of stuff. Damn, you really live like this? I want to believe that this happens due to ignorance; anybody who engages with inflammatory media on purpose should seek professional help.

## Fishing
Ah yes, fishing, an activity that I have never partaken in, ever. If you're active on the internet, you've probably heard of the term "trolling". What some of you reading this might not know is that the term actually originated from fishing, not the mythical creature that swears you're not crossing his bridge. "Trolling" in the context of fishing is the act of dragging bait behind a boat to catch fish. The unsuspecting fish race after the boat for what they think is an easy meal, only to become somebody's dinner. Do you get it now? You're the fish, running around the internet latching on to digital bait except unlike the actual fish, which get a taste of some nice crayfish, you get absolutely nothing. There's an age-old saying that was once a staple of every forum in the early days of the internet, but has since faded into obscurity. "Don't Feed The Trolls". Now I would feel real dumb if I was only just realizing the reality of this dynamic, although I feel as if it's common knowledge that you shouldn't lose peace over random people on the internet. You're just finding out about baiting (highly unlikely)? Congrats. You're already familiar? Also congrats. You'll both still fall for the bait. It's not your fault. But why? 

## Olympic-Level Fishermen
Our modern-day trolls are _built different_; the result of careful planning, strong motivation, possibly millions of dollars in investments, and decades of controlled evolution. Trolls back then did it purely for the love of the game. The only benefit to their actions was the satisfaction of watching you dance to their tunes like a puppet. Now the trolls are making a fortune off your displeasure. I'm not talking about the blue ticks of X, TikTok influencers, or individual YouTube creators who employ ragebait or descend into degeneracy to farm engagement. They're small fry. I'm talking about complex, well-oiled machines that operate at near-maximum efficiency. Ever heard of Jubilee? You have? Then you know what I'm talking about. You haven't? God bless your soul, please keep it that way, I beg you. These large media companies, independent or otherwise, are the Indominus Rexes of modern trolls. They know very well how to manipulate the brain's psychology to their advantage. They sensationalize stories to capture attention, framing news in a way that appeals to emotions rather than reason. They create clickbait headlines and controversial narratives that generate views and clicks, even if it means distorting facts. They don't just prey on your anger, but every single emotion you have. They're masters of the dark arts that will use every tactic imaginable, and even those inconceivable, to get you to engage with their content. They thrive on conflict and division, reinforcing biases and manipulating public opinion to serve their bottom line regardless of whether it aligns with truth or public well-being. They don't want you to be open to new ideas or engage in meaningful discussions to inform your beliefs, they want to think for you.

## Do Nothing
I admit I'm being a little dramatic, but I just want you to understand that your _opps_ aren't playing fair. You cannot, under any circumstances, allow yourself to unconsciously consume anything on the internet. In fact, you should be mindful at all times, not just on the internet. Your consciousness is the gatekeeper of the bridge to your soul, the only filter for what goes in and out of your mind. As it is written, "Above all else, guard your heart, for everything you do flows from it" (Proverbs 4:23 NIV). And with that, you are able to use your superpowerâ€”the only ability you need to defeat these evil titans (and the small fry as well). Do nothing. Yes you read that right, do nothing. Don't correct that intentionally tone-deaf take, don't take news outlets at their word, don't respond, don't react. I don't think I need to tell you not to deliberately seek out bait-like content (unless you enjoy that type of stuff in which case go crazy but again, seek help). You're a spectator of information, and that's all you're seeing: information. The choice is in your hands; you don't have to internalize it. Life goes on whether you comment or not. Your attention is the prize; the only way to defeat the trolls is by ignoring their activities because any reaction whatsoever is advantageous to them. The implications of your actions in this scenario can only be detrimental to you. Think about it, is it worth the effort?

So the next time you come across a Jubilee video in your YouTube recommendations, or a post on X that's clearly engagement farming, or even a politically skewed news headline, intentionally ignore them. Actively **do nothing**.
