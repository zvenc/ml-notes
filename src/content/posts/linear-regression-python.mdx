A linear regression model can be implemented in Python using `numpy` and `matplotlib`. `numpy` is an open-source Python library for working with large multi-dimensional arrays. It provides helpful mathematical functions to operate on these arrays efficiently. `numpy` is used for data analysis, machine learning and many other tasks that require numerical computing. `matplotlib` is an open-source visualization library, also in Python, that provides a framework to create a variety of plots including scatter plots, pie charts, histograms, etc.

# Python Implementation of Linear Regression
```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.plot as plt
```
