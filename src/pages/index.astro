	<p><em>John McAfee was once sighted at a rural bar in Vietnam. Some of the locals who recognized him enquired about his presence there. He responded with a number of absurd statements, even claiming to be an NPC in a videogame. One account has him saying, "Antivirus quantum flux, bacon matrix, password is medium-rare but only if the moon is up-sideways."</em></p>
